        At Rowan University, as part of my Mechatronics 2019 course, my team and
        I were given the creative freedom to choose our own project. This project
        was an intersection between two of my non-engineering interests: environmental
        sustainability, and art. The project was inspired by Jiri Praus's 'Ever Blooming
        Mechanical Tulip'. My team and I were all intrigued by this intersection between
        Arduino IDE programming and art since the majority of our projects are usually 
        just made to fulfill a function. This project was new to us since it allowed 
        us to tap into the creative side of engineering. Rather than using wire 
        sculpting as our medium, I used 3D printing technology and SolidWorks modeling
        to create the form of our mechanical flower and to model its blooming 
        function in a CAD assembly. Overall, I'd have to say this is my favorite project
        I've done thus far. My future plans for this design is to downsize it to reduce
        printing time and material costs for the purpose of mass-manufacturing for my
        design for a giveaway prize at a Rowan University networking event.

          For the design phase of this project, I researched various mechanical blooming mechanisms
          before I settled on a pushing rod mechanism similar to the one Jiri used. To actuate my 
          design mechanically, I created a center piece containing a hex nut that could travel up 
          along a threaded rod. The rod is connected to a servo motor via a motor adapter piece. 
          It was daunting translating the design into SolidWorks due to the dimensional accuracy
          necessary for the petals to close flush and to open fully via the pushing rod. But I 
          was able to develop a simple method of creating a symmetrical petal shape in SolidWorks
          and placing all my components in an assembly allowed me to troubleshoot any issues.

       The team and I could have called it a day after we 3D printed the flower parts... but 
       what's the fun in that! After assembling the flower, my teammate and good friend Sara had the 
       brilliant idea of making the flower look life-like by sleeving the 3D printed petals
       with fabric petals from JoAnn's Fabrics. We placed the flower in a painted shoebox to mimic 
       the look of a planter box. The planter box also served the duel purpose of housing all of
       our electronic components. Between the electronics and the flower, was a styrofoam layer
       that we painted brown to mimic the look of dirt. We also added an additional non-blooming 
       garden alongside the central flower.

         The project would have been kinda boring if we just twisted our threaded rod manually. Plus
         we'd be missing the 'Tronics' of the mechatronics course. Actuating the flower was simple 
         once the design was done. I attached a stepper motor to the motor adapter piece and 
         programmed the stepper motor to turn the flower into its open and closed position when an
         Ultrasonic Sensor detected motion in its surroundings. We also programmed a speaker
         to begin playing the 'Howl's Moving Castle Theme' song once the flower began blooming by 
         programming each individual note. For a dash of pizzazz, we added in some extra LED's amongst
         the non-functioning flowers to create an LED flower garden.
