    This is the first engineering project I've ever done and the most challenging one for 
    that very reason. It introduced me to my first machining process on the
    laser cutter, SolidWorks modeling, linkage design, Arduino IDE programming, soldering
    PCB boards, and 3D printing. We were provided with three servo actuators and one ultrasonic
    sensor. The ultimate goal of this project was to design a fully autonomous claw mechanism
    meeting the following requirements
        <ul class = "w3-left"> 
          <li>Design and 3D print a SolidWorks model of the object to be grasped</li>
          <li>Design a claw and claw lifter using at least 1 fourbar linkage</li>
          <li>Design a tower and rotation mechanism for the claw that will move the object
              from one drop zone to the next drop zone in a 90 degree rotation</li>
          <li>Program the lifter mechanism to pick up the object and the rotation mechanism 
              to move the object when it is placed in the designated drop zone. </li>
          
        </ul>

          For the first part of the project, my team and I brainstormed an easy object for us to
          pick up. The only constraints were that it fit within a 1.5" x 1.5" cube. We determined
          from the start that having a purse like design to the cube would make it easy for the claw
          to grab. I modeled it in SolidWorks by creating an 'X shape with 4 loops on each side through which
          the claw grippers could go through. To minimize weight, I created a curved profile at the
          bottom and shelled out the inside of the object. I designed my own supports on the inside of 
          the object rather than using the support generator in Cura. My team and I would later design
          our claw mechanism based on this object.

       The project was split into to three deliverables: the claw gripper, the claw lifter, and
       the claw base rotation mechanism. The claw gripper and the claw lifter were both actuated by
       a servo controlling a four-bar linkage mechanism, and the rotation mechanism was comprised
       of two gears also controlled by a servo motor. The rotation mechanism was designed around
       a tower that was comprised of four parts. For the tower, my team and I came up with a 
       puzzle piece design of 4 rectangular walls that we epoxyed together to assemble.

        This project was by far the most stressful and most challenging project I've ever done
        but it is also one of the most rewarding projects I've ever done. From my professor,
        teammates, and classmates I learned about the ingenuity that comes with engineering 
        design.
