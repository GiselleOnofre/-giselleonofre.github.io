        One of the most overlooked traits in engineering projects according to my university's 
        lab technologist is aesthetic appeal. In the past, I've been guilty of negating the form 
        of my project once it achieves full-functionality. However, coming near the end of my 
        university career and as an amateur robotics hobbyist, I've realized that the form of the
        final product is just as important. Thus, in an effort to expand my creative mindset and
        to become a better engineer, I opted to take a sculpture class outside of my major.
        For this project, I created a Mexican cardboard alibrije. The limitations on this project were that: 
        <ul class = "w3-left"> 
            <li>The longest length should be scaled up to at least three feet.</li>
            <li>The only materials to be utilized are: cardboard, brown tape, hot glue, and brown paper.</li>

          </ul>

            Before the sculpting process, I started off by picking two objects that I'd be
            interested in tranforming into a sculpture. I picked a teddy bear and a Mexican alebrije. 
            I determined the difficulty level of each by sketching out their individual components
            and creating potential instructions as to how I would make the object. The difficulty
            level wasn't the ultimate deciding factor. I was particularly interested in creating
            an alebrije sculpture because it tied into my cultural roots in Mexico.

        Going into the project, I only had a rough idea of what I wanted to do. Although I could 
        have created a rounded cardboard shape, I knew that given the limited materials I had, 
        the final product would look like a mess of tape. I was also interested in giving my 
        alebrije figurine a new look because I already thought the rounded body looked slightly
        awkward on the original figurine. I ended up making a geodesic body in my sculpture. Once I had committed to the geodesic shape of the body, 
        creating the original tails, legs, and spikes on the figurine would look unnatural and ruin
        the harmony among the components. Thus, I used a simple triangular shape for the tails,
        legs, and spikes of my alebrije sculpture. The tail was actually a happy coincidence when
        I realized that stacking my triangular legs created a textured dragon tail look. I was also
        able to use my SolidWorks drawing skills on this piece. Rather than tediously measuring out 
        the pentagon shape required to create my geodesic dome, I sped up the process by creating a 
        traceable template. This ensured that each pentagon would precisely line up with each other
        in the body of the alebrije.

        I was really pleased with the final product. Although if I were to do the project again, 
        there are certainly some aspects of it that I would like to clean up on the look. Specifically,
        I'd like to rework the head to create the rounded look of the neck without the need for brown tape.
        However, given the time constraings and limitations on the project, I'd consider this a 
        successful endeavour and this is certainly a medium that I'll continue to explore in the future.
