        At Rowan University, I took a practicum course called ME lab where one of our core
        projects was to create a multitool. I was given the dimensions for the tool and 
        were instructed to make a SolidWorks model and part drawings for the tool. Using my
        drawings, I utilized a lathe, mill, waterjet, and arbor press, to fabricate my multitool.

        The multitool was one of my first introductions to SolidWorks. Within this course, I learned
        the best methods of creating parts and assemblies in SolidWorks. Using those lessons,
        I was easily able to create my multitool in SolidWorks. It consists of three dowel pins,
        a yellow handle, a screwdriver bit, a bit holder, a magnet, and a wrench.

        After completing my SolidWorks parts, I made drawings for the parts that I would later
        fabricate. These included the wrench, the holder, and the handle. The main goal of this
        was to understand 3 view diagrams as well as how to tolerance a part. This gave me an 
        idea of the accuracy that each machine would be able to achieve and the time it would
        require to achieve a desired tolerance.

        The final result of my machining project was pretty successful I'd say. It was 
        definitely a new learning experience for me. Most other students had some experience
        with machine shops and woodworking machines at their high schools so it was daunting
        for me especially to use a lathe, and mill for the first time. This project was a great
        introduction however and it gave a me not only familiarity with the machines but also
        helped me hone my machining skills for future projects.
